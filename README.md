# Marvel 101
Marvel 101 makes various calls to the official [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) and retreives JSON responses, parses them and then uses the parsed data to allow the users to either browse or search for
their favorite character, comic, event or creator.
## Features
<ul>
  <li>Giving the users the ability to search through Marvel's MASSIVE data base of comics, characters, creators and events</li>
  <li>Allowing the users to simply browse all catagories if they don't have a specific item to search for</li>
  <li>For each catagory, you get various information associated with the item like a comics' synopsis or an event's running period </li>
  <li>All information is presented in a neat manner and items can be clicked on to show additional details if the user is interested</li>
  <li>All items have links to Marvel's website to, for example, allow the user to read/purchase a comic and more </li>
  <li>All the data retrieved with each call is parsed to hide useless info that the user might not interested in</li>
</ul>

## Usage
If, for some reason, you want to clone the repository and run the APP on your local machine then first you have to create a Java file called "SECRET_KEYS". In the file, you need the following static, final strings: "PUBLIC_KEY" and "PRIVATE_KEY" and each will hold your API keys that you get by creating an account at [Marvel's website](https://developer.marvel.com/).

## Potential Additions

<ul>
  <li> More catagories might be added in the future even though the current ones cover almost everything </li>
  <li> Add even more information for each item </li>
  <li> If more calls get added to the Marvel API then the app will be improved further </li>
</ul>
